## Step 2 : In your Jupyter Editor : Answer the following questions 

# - Does this ECG look correctly scaled to you ? Please explain
      The graphe of the Lead I shows an unclear aspect of the different PQRST waves that seems occured du to an too small scale.
# - Is this a normal ECG ? Please explain
      Due to the scale limitation we cannot perform a complete analysis of the ECG waves, by the way, the original data only provide us the leads I, II and III.
      However, we can conclude that we have a regular, sinusal (all the P waves are followed by a QRS complex) rythm (between 60 an 90 bpm), with only 3 leads we can not determine the axis of this ecg.
      P waves seems normals, the PR-segment seems to have a regular lenght, QRS are thin, the negative T waves on the lead II can be an argument in favor a cardiac dysfunction (maybe linked to the supposed STEMI ?)
      On the lead III we can suppose the existence of an ST-segment elevation (in favor of an inferior STEMI) but further investigation is needed (more leads !)
